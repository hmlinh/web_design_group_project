              The United Nations Global Goals and Choice of Topic
            </h3>
            <p>
              In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly set up 17 interlinked
              global goals related to the environment’s preservation, entitled
              Global Goals, or the Sustainable Development Goals. They are
              intended to be achieved by 2030. <br />
              <br />

              In order for them to be achieved, all human beings around the
              world are asked to be aware of the environment’s protection
              through the advent of renewable energies, metamorphoses of
              businesses and overall progress. <br />
              <br />

              Growing economy worldwide is usually synonymous with increasing
              the impact on the environment. Climate change, growing extinction
              of fauna and flora, the appearance of pathogens and the
              multiplication of diseases are just the emerging part of the
              iceberg. Many activists have taken this matter into their own
              hands to defend the planet's interests, and as a part of this
              planet, it is also our duty to have a positive impact on our
              environment. <br />
              <br />

              Directly related to Goal 8 of the Global Goals, we focus on the
              following topic:
              <strong
                >“Decoupling economic growth from environmental
                degradation”</strong
              >. This subject is based on the quick transformation businesses
              are going through all over the world and this includes the several
              implementations of new energies, overuse of natural resources and
              chemical reactions. With this in mind, we are not against economic
              growth but we deeply think that economic development should not
              happen without environmental preservation.

              Brainstorming & Research Question
            </h3>
            <p>
              In total adequacy with the Global Goals, and the Goal number 8
              which hails our interest in a particular way, we have formulated
              together a research question which helped us brainstorm and find
              the perfect project idea:
              <em>
                “How to raise citizens’ awareness about their daily consumption
                behaviour through the implementation of tools which lower their
                impact on the environment?” </em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Recently, having an eco-responsible profile became a lifestyle.
              Citizens who are adopting eco-friendly habits generally try to
              watch out for their actions when it comes to plastic waste,
              recycling products’ packaging and the list goes on. What we have
              noticed is that actions regarding the energies’ overuse are rare.
              Thus, we have decided to mainly tackle this point. From this
              brainstorming came the idea of reducing one’s energy consumption
              at home.

              Design Thinking
            </h3>
            <p>
              As a team, we decided to apply the design thinking method to
              create our project. We followed the following steps:
            </p>
            <ul id="list">
              <li>
                <strong>Empathise:</strong> we looked at the current situation
                of a few big issues arising from businesses and their impact on
                society. We thought of food waste, climate change, wood
                industry, etc. We then thought of a big issue: heating, more
                precisely, heating in the European continent. We notice an
                important thing: most people spend a great deal of time
                adjusting their heater temperature due to temperature
                fluctuations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Define: </strong> we started asking around ourselves who
                were the people facing this challenge but although it could be
                anyone, we decided to focus on a specific persona: young student
                females who are concerned about the environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Ideate:</strong> we decided to see what solutions could
                help them and we came up with a few ideas: a fitness app to
                track protein intake, a recycle code barre scanning app, and
                finally a thermo hygrometer to check the heating performances at
                home. Our targets being informed students, we wanted to create
                something that would help them track their energetic
                consumptions while also helping them with their finances.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prototype: </strong>we created wireframes and then
                mockups to make our idea come true. We applied a few designs and
                collaborated on building it from scratch with the help of our
                research.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Test:</strong> we conducted a few user tests with
                profiles corresponding to our main target. We received feedback
                and adapted our prototype accordingly.

              Birth of Smarthermo and Technology Behind It
            </h3>
            <p>
              As previously explained, the idea is to reduce our energy’s use at
              home. As we are in the cold wintertime, our heating at home never
              stops working. This reflection led us to the idea of reducing the
              energy used for heatings. In order to do so, we must not provide
              users with a temperature that keeps them freezing inside their
              houses, and at the same time, we shouldn’t overuse our energy.
              This is why we decided to have a comparison between the
              temperature inside a room and the one outside, and to suggest to
              the user the most optimal degree of temperature to regulate
              heating.
              <br />
              <br />
              The name of the application “Smarthermo” came from the marriage of
              the digital transformation which demands using smartphones and
              devices, and the main actor in our idea which is the thermo
              hygrometer.

              <br />
              <br />
              Having the knowledge to design the app, we decided to unite our
              forces with the company Govee which has now fusioned with
              Smarthermo. Govee used to only show air temperature and humidity.
              By associating with Smarthermo, Govee has won in technical
              know-how and extended its basic functionalities by implementing
              new features.
              <br />
              <br />
              See how the previous model looked like:

                allowfullscreen
              ></iframe>
            </center>

            <p>
              <br />
              The main feature of this project is to estimate the optimal
              temperature for each room in one’s house. Smarthermo includes an
              “insights'' section and a heat map that you can personalize which
              will update itself automatically and let you see what your home
              looks like.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the “extra” section, you can keep track of your progress by
              seeing how much energy you have saved. If the amount meets the
              target we have set, you will get a chance to have a 5 euros
              voucher to spend at our partners' stores. Our partners all are
              certified B corporations which respect the environment. If you
              wish, you may also use your voucher to make a donation to the
              Climate Justice Alliance (CJA*).

              Application’s Wireframe
            </h3>
            <p>
              After finding the perfect idea for our project, imagining the
              process and giving it a name, it was time to come up with the 1st
              wireframe. The latter involves the development of all screen
              images and pages possibly visited by the user in his phase of
              navigating on the application and checking all the features.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 1st step was answering the main need which is estimating the
              optimal temperature in each room in the house. Then, the next
              features intervene too as completing activities and each one of
              them should be able to be presented in an individual page.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thus, the wireframe gave birth to the whole application’s design
              and organization which were developed on Figma Application :

            <p>
              There are a few thermo hygrometers available on the market. They
              are mostly used to measure humidity and air temperature at a given
              time. However, none allows you to geolocate your environment to
              foresee what your heater temperature should be like based on your
              home blueprint.
              <br />
              <br />
              Govee was one of those solutions but thanks to our partnership, we
              have been able to leverage their offer and to not have to produce
              devices which would have been an important cost for us.

              Thanks to insights we have gained from the user tests, we will

            <ul id="list">
              <li>
                Make Smarthermo a solution adapted to both heater and air
                conditioner so seasonality does not impact our project too much.
              </li>
              <li>
                Build smart heaters and smart plugs for people to buy a heater
                that can be modified remotely through the app and plugs that can
                adapt to any electric heater to establish a connection with
                other smart home devices compatible with Smarthermo app such as
                Alexa or Google Home.
