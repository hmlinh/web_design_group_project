              The United Nations Global Goals and choice of topic
            </h3>
            <p>
              In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly set up 17 interlinked
              global goals related to the environment’s preservation, entitled
              Global Goals, or the Sustainable Development Goals. They are
              intended to be achieved by 2030. In order for them to be achieved,
              all human beings around the world are asked to be aware of the
              environment’s protection, and how with the advent of renewable
              energies, factories, metamorphoses in terms of business and
              technical progress in general, growing economy all over the world
              is usually synonym of growing the impact on the environment.
              Climate change, growing extinction of fauna and flora, the
              appearance of pathogens and the multiplication of diseases are
              just the emerging part of the iceberg. Many activists have taken
              this matter into their own hands to defend the planet's interests,
              and as a part of this planet, it is our duty to have a positive
              impact on our environment too.
            </p>

            <p>
              Directly related to Goal 8 of the Global Goals, our main topic is
              <strong
                >“Decoupling economic growth from environmental
                degradation”</strong
              >. The choice of this subject is based on the quick transformation
              business is going through all over the world and this includes the
              several implementations of new energies, overuse of natural
              resources and chemical reactions. This says, we are not against
              economic growth, however, we are looking for ways to boost the
              economy while preserving our environment.

              Brainstorming & Research Question
            </h3>
            <p>
              In total adequacy with the Global Goals, and the Goal number 8
              which hails our interest in a particular way, we have formulated
              together a research question which helped us brainstorm and find
              the perfect project idea:
              <em>
                “How to raise citizens’ awareness about their daily consumption
                behaviour through the implementation of tools which lower their
                impact on the environment?” </em
              ><br />
              <br />
              Recently, having an eco-responsible profile became a lifestyle.
              Citizens who are adopting eco-friendly habits generally try to
              watch out for their actions when it comes to plastic waste,
              recycling products’ packaging and the list goes on. What we have
              noticed is that actions regarding the energies’ overuse are rare.
              Thus, we have decided to mainly tackle this point. From this
              brainstorming came the idea of reducing one’s energy consumption
              at home.

              Birth of Smarthermo
            </h3>
            <p>
              As previously explained, the idea is to reduce our energy’s use at
              home. As we are in the core of winter, our heating at home never
              stops working. This reflection led us to the idea of reducing the
              energy used for heatings. In order to do so, we must not provide
              users with a temperature that keeps them freezing inside their
              houses, and at the same time, we shouldn’t over use our energy.
              This is why we decided to have a comparison between the
              temperature inside a room and the one outside, and to suggest the
              user the most optimal degree of temperature to regulate his
              heating<br />
              <br />
              The name of the application “Smarthermo” came from the marriage of
              the digital transformation which demands using smart phones and
              devices, and the main actor in our idea which is the thermostat.
              <br />
              <br />
              The main feature or activity of this project is to estimate the
              optimal temperature for each room in one’s house. As for the
              support activities, they are able to measure the room temperature
              on site, to visualize temperatures of the heater in each room
              through a heatmap, to provide the user with personalized insights
              based on his history and last, it offers useful tips and updates
              on latest developments in this field.

              Application’s sketching
            </h3>
            <p>
              After finding the perfect idea for our project, imagining the
              process and giving it a name, it was time to come up with a 1st
              sketching. The latter involves the development of all screen
              images and pages possibly visited by the user in his phase of
              navigating on the application and checking all the features.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 1st step was answering the main need which is estimating the
              optimal temperature in each room in the house. Then, the next
              features intervene too as completing activities and each one of
              them should be able to be presented in an individual page.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thus, the sketching gave birth to the whole application’s design
              and organization which were developed on Figma Application :
